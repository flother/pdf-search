Development environment
=======================

The project is written in Python version 3.6 and uses [pipenv](https://docs.pipenv.org/) to manage dependencies and the virtual environment. To set up a development environment, run:

```sh
pipenv install --dev
pipenv shell
```

If you can run `espdf --help` without error then everything's ready.
